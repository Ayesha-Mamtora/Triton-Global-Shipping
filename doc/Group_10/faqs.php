                        orders we send. If you have received an item which is different to that which you ordered please contact us immediately on 1300 145 000(Tollfree) and 07-4356 7654, 044 765-439(Store) or email on prideinperfume@hotmail.com.<br><br>                        3.

Are the prices on your website the same as in your stores?<br> Yes, we like to think of our website as one of our stores. The prices and offers will therefore be the same online and in store, subject to stock availablity.<br><br>                        5. What's the difference between Aftershave, EDT and EDP?<br> Quite simply it is the difference in the amount or concentration of the fragrance oils in a perfume. A higher concentration fragrance will last longer, and won't need
                        as much applying.<br><br>
